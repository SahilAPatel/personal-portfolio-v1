The first step to doing something is beliving you can do it, weather it be getting an amazing job, landing the girl of your dreams or beating your best mile record. The premise of the book is great but I feel like the delivery of contrent is not for me. Book goes over various thinking exercises by placing you in real world examples that I cannot realte to, hence I stopped reading.</td>
